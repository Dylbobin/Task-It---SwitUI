Task-It
=======================

Task-It, inspired by the Reminders app by Apple, is a SwiftUI application with the purpose of holding important tasks
that the user wants to complete in a given time frame.  Time and time again, important activities that people want to
complete everyday get swept under the rug of todayâ€™s problems, forgetting the objective of the day. By incorporating 
Task-It into your day-to-day life, Task-It aims to solve these problems.  Through seamless interface, three click design,
and tags for task importance, users will begin to complete their tasks and end their day satisfied.
